1. Create new VMs (3 in my example)
2. Remember to increase storage from default template (you should also increase Master and Worker nodes if you haven't).
3. Make static IPs for each
4. Copy script (longhorn.sh) to your admin machine (make executable)
5. Run script
6. Enjoy Longhorn

Let me know if it doesn't work!
